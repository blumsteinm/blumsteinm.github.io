**Actively recruiting for August 2024 start date!**

## Undergraduate
We will update this section for academic year 2024-2025. Feel free to [browse](https://evsc.as.virginia.edu/graduate-mentor-list) other interesting opportunities in the department in the meantime. 

## Graduate Students
Please check out UVA Environmental Science Department's [graduate website](https://evsc.as.virginia.edu/graduate) for more information on applying and requirements. 

I highly encourage prospective students to reach out to me by email prior to the application due date with a short statement of interest and a copy of the resume/cv. I also encourage students to apply for graduate fellowships during their application process, which I will happily work on with prospective students. While PhDs are funded, these fellowships would afford you more flexibility in your research interests, a higher pay rate, and great preparation for future fellowship and grant applications. 

Relevant programs include: 

* [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/)
* [DOD NDSEG](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/)
* [USDA AFRI](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/funding-opportunities/agriculture-food-research-initiative-education-workforce-development)
* [Ford Foundation Fellowship](https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/index.htm)

[Here's](https://seas.umich.edu/prospective-students) a helpful site from Michigan on how to prepare and apply to graduate school.
